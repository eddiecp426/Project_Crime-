FBI Crime Data API
The FBI Crime Data API is a web service that returns JSON or CSV data detailing various aspects pertaining to crime. Agencies input information using one of two reporting formats: The Summary Reporting System (SRS) or the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS). 

The Data collected from this API contains summarized agency data and NIBRS counts. 

With the data collected, we viewed a subset of crimes (burglary, vandalism, murder, embezzlement and drunkness) and how they are affected in New York, Arizona, Michigan, and Texas between the years 1995 and 2015.

In this repository you will view our findings.
